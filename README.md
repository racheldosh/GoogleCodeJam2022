# Google Code Jam 2022

## Qualification Round

Uploading my solutions to the Google Code Jam 2022 Qualification Round problems.

[Link to problems and optimal solutions](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000876ff1)

Each problem is contained in its own directory with an `input.txt` file for input and a `solution.py` file for the solution. The python file runs via `python solution.py` command on the command line and prints out the solution. The solutions have been modified slightly since competition time to allow for this input/output style. 

I only completed the first three problems in the time that I had. My solutions are written in Python.
